Setting Up Reviews for your Repository
======================================

Setup
-----
Setting up reviews is a super simple.

All you need to do is `enable reviews for your repository 
<http://jmsyst.com/automated-code-reviews/repositories/new>`_.

In case, you have not granted us the ``public_repo`` permission yet, this will
redirect you to Github first. Once, you added a repository, the system will
automatically set-up the required hook on Github for you.
